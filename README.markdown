INSTALL
=======

You need to install nodejs and expressjs first.

node: http://nodejs.org/
express: http://expressjs.com/

I think that's pretty much it.. it also uses socket.io but that should be vendored..

to run the app just do `node app.js` and open localhost:3000. Try opening it in different browsers/tabs and seeing the websockets magic in action.

Needless to say, there are probable 2 billion bugs in this code.. but it's just a draft to look into the possibilities of node,socket.io and crafty in general.
